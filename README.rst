What is this?
-------------

`CERN Analysis Preservation <https://analysispreservation.cern.ch>`_ is a data preservation service developed and run at `CERN <https://home.cern/about>`_ to provide a centralized platform for physicists to capture and preserve the knowledge behind their physics analyses so that it is understandable and reusable in the future. It is currently targeting analysis information produced by the LHC experiments.

CAP is designed to support physicists during their research, so we make sure to apply access control to all information added to the platform. Users retain full control of their information and data.
