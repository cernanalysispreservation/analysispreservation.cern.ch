# Admin panel

The admin panel lets you access existing schemas for your collaboration to either view or edit them, as well as create new schemas or import them from JSON files. It is only accessible by users with admin privileges in the collaboration.

If you have such privileges, you can access the admin panel at https://analysispreservation.cern.ch/admin or by clicking on the _Admin_ button at the bottom right of the screen in CAP.

The tools available in the admin section are listed below.

## Schema viewer

The schema viewer displays the JSON schemas and lets you do manual changes to certain parts of them. You can use the diff view to see your changes, and you can easily revert or save them.

## Form builder

The form builder is a powerful tool which makes it easy to interactively create and edit forms. It includes a **tour** that we encourage you to follow in order to understand the basics of the tool. The tour is automatically run on your first visit to the admin, and can be run manually whenever you needed by clicking on the _Tour_ button in the bottom right corner of the form builder.

## Notifications

The notifications tab allows you to define notifications for a given category. You can add as many notifications as you want, each of them with a different content and addressed to different people. The email notifications can contain information directly extracted from the form, using the provided _context options_.
