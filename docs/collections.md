# Collections

The collections page is a centralized place from which you can access all drafts and published records for that collection, being able to **filter** by version.

It contains a **permissions** table showing all permissions assigned to users, which are applied globally to all records in the collection.
Each entry indicates the type of the user (egroup or user), and its permissions for read, create, review, update and admin, for both drafts (D) and published records (P).

Admins are also able to define a **readme** for the collection, which can be useful to provide some instructions for other members of the collaboration.
