# Welcome to the Documentation for CERN Analysis Preservation

[CERN Analysis Preservation (CAP)](https://analysispreservation.cern.ch) is an open source preservation service run at CERN which is targeted at capturing and preserving physics analysis information generated by researchers at CERN in a secure environment where users retain full control of their information and data.

We want to make it easier for physicists to find, understand and reuse analysis information just as they have done before but with less effort involved. CAP has been designed to seamlessly integrate into collaboration workflows, so that information can be captured and preserved at the earliest stage and throughout an analysis life-cycle - including during the reviewing process, but also after publication and many years in the future to make sure analyses can be retrieved, shared or reused.
